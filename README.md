 Flutter application for my college that simplifies the process of requesting gate passes, medical leaves, wifi-access, late entry, and duty leave
for students.
> All the request first go to Advisor and then HOD(head of department).Only on acceptance by both Qr code for validation appears.
> Students no longer need to seek out teachers or administrative staff to make these requests, resulting in a more efficient and streamlined process.
> Uses Firebase as backend.
> Generates an encrypted QR code which can be scanned by authorities to verify
